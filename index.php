            <p class="lead" style="font-family:Champagne;padding-right:15px;">The ISM Dhanbad Student Chapter of the ACM was established in 2011 to address the needs of the ISM Dhanbad computing community. The chapter organizes talks and workshops on different subjects by speakers who are well known in their area.

These talks give students opportunities to learn about advanced research subjects. Regular coding competition are also organized to develop healthy competitive environment among the students. It serves as a dynamic hub of activity where those that are passionate about computing come to meet, interact, and learn from one another.</p>
